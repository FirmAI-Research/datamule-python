Need to generalize XML hierachies to be suitable for Table classes

hmm. issue is we probably want to identify tables first
so e.g. nonderivativetable geninfo investorsecs

then apply flatten on those tables.

THEN RENAME them. but we can actually do this AFTER PROCESSING

so we need to double check that flatten dict does what we think then just feed in the proper tables.

tables need add column
tables need mapping func
