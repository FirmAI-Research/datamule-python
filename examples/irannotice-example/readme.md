This repo hosts the DataMule tutorial centered on the IRAN NOTICE form. IRAN NOTICEs are fascinating because they contain almost no information themselves—they’re just a heads-up that the company has done business in Iran. The real details are buried in the 10-K/Q filings.

The tutorial has three planned sections:

1. Basic Plotting
2. Network Graphing, e.g. [Force-directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing#/media/File:SocialNetworkAnalysis.png)
3. Parser Tutorial: Focused on extracting Iran disclosure text directly from the 10-K/Q and then passing it to genai.
