        <footnote id="F1">The reported securities are convertible at any time at the option of the Reporting Person, but automatically convert into shares of Class B Common Stock on a 1:1 basis immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, estimated to be on or about December 21, 2011.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Not applicable.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Reporting Person into one share of Class A Common Stock and has no expiration date. Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into Class A Common Stock on the date on which the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock together represent less than 10% of the aggregate combined voting power of the Issuer's capital stock. In addition, each share of Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A Common Stock upon (i) any transfer, whether or not for value, (subject to certain exceptions), or (ii) in the event of death of the Reporting Person</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">Shares held directly by Reid Hoffman and Michelle Yee Living Trust dated October 27, 2009. Mr. Hoffman and his spouse serve as trustees.  Mr. Hoffman retains sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the share held by the trust.</footnote>

    <remarks>In addition to the securities reported herein, as described in the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the Issuer's initial public offering (the &quot;IPO&quot;), the Reporting Person holds restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), the vesting of which are subject to the satisfaction of both a service-based condition and a liquidity event-based condition. As a result, the RSUs are not yet considered reportable for purposes of Section 16, and are not reflected on this Form 3. The liquidity event-based condition of the RSUs will be satisfied upon the execution and effectiveness of an underwriting agreement by and among the Issuer, the underwriters and certain selling stockholders of the Issuer, in connection with the IPO and, therefore, the Reporting Person will file a Form 4 following the execution of the Underwriting Agreement with respect to RSUs that vest at such time.</remarks>
