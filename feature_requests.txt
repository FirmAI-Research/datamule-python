Feature Requests:

Rewrite indexing to allow filter portfolio by ticker/cik and more
1. Test solution - store metadata for portfolio in one place using new tabular stuff
portfolio/
--metadata1.csv (e.g. owners)
--metadata2.csv (e.g documents)
--accno1/
--accno2/

- easier way to join listed + unlisted filer names using datamule

Monitor rewrite + docs


others:
* rewrite portfolio to take advantage of parallel procesor executor
* rewrite secsgml to be safer wrt to '>', also faster and optimized for parallel processing using rust
* fix datamule sec archive cik issue
* fix sec downloader tqdm prog
* oops! we're not doing async right for downloader. fixing this probably 2x-3x speed.

eftsquery
* add sics filtering in search-index
* add mailing/biz? not sure which address using locationCodes=M0
* add principle office using filter_location
*add items e.g. https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#items=1.01,2.01


datamule-data
* add cik accession etc dataset that updates daily. ~500mb, so gz maybe ~100mb? neat to target <50mb......
