# Requests For Contribution

There are a lot of cool things you can do with this package. If you build something cool, happy to add it to the github.

## Suggestions

### Bots
* Discord Bot - Using [monitor_submissions](https://john-friedman.github.io/datamule-python/datamule-python/portfolio/portfolio/#monitor_submissions) create a discord bot that pushes new SEC submissions to the channel. 
    - my (deprecated) bot did quite well on reddit

### Data
* Do something cool with Form D data - (startups use Form D to raise capital)
* Track what percent of equity founders retain in companies over time (visible in 3,4,5, as well as Schedule 13D/G)
    - this has been requested by multiple people (including former CEOs)
* Map out investor networks using insider disclosures (Forms 3,4 and 5) - e.g. can we see distinct "factions" in Silicon Valley
* Map out what companies are exposed to the Russo-Ukrainian War using [search_submissions](https://john-friedman.github.io/datamule-python/datamule-python/index/#search_submissions)
