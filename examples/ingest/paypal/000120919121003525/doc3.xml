        <footnote id="F1">As joint settlors of the Levchin 2012 Irrevocable Trust, the Reporting Person and his spouse jointly have the right to acquire the shares held by the trust but do not have voting or investment power over such shares. The Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein, and the inclusion of these shares in this report shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of all of the reported shares for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each share of the Issuer's Class B common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (&quot;Class B Common Stock&quot;), is convertible at any time into one share of the Issuer's Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (&quot;Class A Common Stock&quot;). The Class B Common Stock has no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The Reporting Person has sole voting and investment power over the shares held by 2012 MRL Investments LLC.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">As described in the Issuer's registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-250184) (the &quot;S-1&quot;) under the heading &quot;Executive and Director Compensation-New Chief Executive Officer Compensation,&quot; in connection with the Issuer's initial public offering, the Reporting Person was granted a multi-year performance-based stock option providing the Reporting Person with the opportunity to earn the ability to purchase shares Class A Common Stock (the &quot;Value Creation Award&quot;). The Value Creation Award will only be earned if the Class A Common Stock attains certain stock price hurdles over a period of five years, as further described in the S-1 under the heading &quot;Executive and Director Compensation-New Chief Executive Officer Compensation,&quot; subject to the Reporting Person's continued service to the Issuer. (continued in next footnote)</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">The Value Creation Award is divided into ten tranches which the Reporting Person may earn by satisfying a performance condition within a five-year period from the date of grant. Once earned as a result of satisfying the performance condition, the earned tranche of the Value Creation Award becomes vested and exercisable upon the satisfaction of a time condition. Any portion of the Value Creation Award that has not been earned by the fifth anniversary of the grant date will be forfeited.</footnote>
