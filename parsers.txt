1. XML parser + pass in dict - needs to be flexible for dict / list issue

2. Generalized 10K parser - pass in parts mapping via dict
- use this to setup most varieties of item parsers.
- should also work for 8-k etc

TOC END issue - need to find more robust TOC finding
- can always use with parts mapping - probably bandaid fix
