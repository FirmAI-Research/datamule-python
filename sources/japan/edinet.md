I'm looking into adding functionality for EDINET - japans version of EDGAR

EDIT: Looks like this requires an api-key, which seems to require submitting a form to japanese government and waiting a week.

If there is enough user demand - I'll look into getting an API key, and add the data into the datamule data provider. Please contact me to request this.

Note: bit hard to figure this API out due to language barrier
