        <footnote id="F1">The Class B Common Stock is convertible into the issuer's Class A Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis (a) at the holder's option or (b) upon certain transfers of such shares and has no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These shares were initially reported on a Form 4 dated July 23, 2014 as having been acquired in connection with the issuer's acquisition of Oculus VR, Inc. (&quot;Oculus&quot;). The shares were held in escrow to secure the Oculus stockholders' obligations to indemnify the issuer for certain matters set forth in the amended and restated merger agreement dated April 21, 2014 (the &quot;Merger Agreement&quot;). Pursuant to these indemnity obligations, on May 17, 2019, 24,791 shares were forfeited and are being returned to the issuer for no consideration. Following this forfeiture, neither the reporting person nor the holder owns such forfeited shares or has voting or investment power over, or a pecuniary interest in, the forfeited shares. In addition, 16,840 shares of Class B Common Stock that were held in escrow were released to the holder on May 17, 2019.</footnote>

The reporting person otherwise disclaims beneficial ownership over such securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.  The inclusion of these securities in this report shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purposes.</footnote>
