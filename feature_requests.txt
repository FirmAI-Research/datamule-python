Filter portfolio by ticker/cik

tinydb is neat, but uses json. we can store as csv for better efficiency, then use custom stuff.
yep probably just do custom stuff using dict comprehension
-yep like this. We will probably change how portfolio is structured
- porbably to:
portfolio/
--metata.json
--accno1/
--accno2/

test if fast enough at 1 million level. can also look into flattening.
yep flattening seems smart, will introduce after next version.
will do 3? tables.
introduce
portfolio.filter_documents(**kwargs)
e.g. filter_documents(type='INFORMATION TABLE,cik=....)
add ticker arg here. add other kwargs like in download submissions
issue with key overlap -> favor tables

add way to update package using datamule-data + refactor setup.py to use that function - setup for next update
-added

document path
- added

multiple people
subset by document type on download. - will do bandaid fix here, before archive rewrite

david
- easier way to join listed + unlisted filer names using datamule


my requests:
* rewrite portfolio to take advantage of parallel procesor executor
* rewrite secsgml to be safer wrt to '>', also faster and optimized for parallel processing using rust
* fix datamule sec archive cik issue
* fix sec downloader tqdm prog
* oops! we're not doing async right for downloader. fixing this probably 2x-3x speed.
