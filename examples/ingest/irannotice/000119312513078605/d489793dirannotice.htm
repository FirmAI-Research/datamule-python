amended, notice is hereby provided that Imperial Oil Limited (the &#147;company&#148;) has made the following disclosure pursuant to those provisions in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2012, which was
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February&nbsp;27, 2013: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:5%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><B>&#147;Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights
Act of 2012 </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:5%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2">The captioned Act was signed by President Obama on August&nbsp;10, 2012. Application of the Act to the company took
effect on October&nbsp;10, 2012. Among other things, the Act requires registrants to disclose, in their annual and quarterly reports, activities covered by the Act which occurred anytime during the period covered by the report, even if such
activities occurred before the effectiveness of the Act and were permitted at the time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:5%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2">During the period from January to September,
2012, the company made several fleet sales of motor fuel with an aggregate total sales price of approximately $11,000 to the Iranian Embassy in Canada. The net earnings attributable to these sales were less than $500. These sales were made without
the involvement of any U.S. person and were permitted by U.S. laws in effect at the time. No sales occurred after the October&nbsp;10, 2012, effective date and the company does not expect any such sales to occur in the future. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:5%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2">The embassy sales stated above represent an activity described in paragraph (D)(iii) of paragraph (1)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;13(r) of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 and therefore are excluded from the required investigation provisions of that statute.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="font-size:24px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&nbsp;</P><DIV ALIGN="right">
